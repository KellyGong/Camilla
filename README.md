A cognitive diagnostic framework for evaluating machine learning model multi-faced Ability


We test our diagnoser on four public datasets: Titanic, CIFAR-100, ESOL and Diamond.

The results of our paper can be reproduced by simply running the following command:
```sh
./multiple_run.sh
```

The training code of learners in each dataset can be found here: [https://github.com/KellyGong/Camilla-Learner-Training](https://github.com/KellyGong/Camilla-Learner-Training)
